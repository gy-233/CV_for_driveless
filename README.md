# Computer Vision for Driverless Vehicles
SoC_Project

This repository contains the code and resources for the project "Computer Vision for Driverless Vehicles." The project aims to explore various aspects of computer vision and implement image processing and object detection techniques using Python and OpenCV. The ultimate goal is to train and deploy a YOLOv5 model for detecting objects in real-time for driverless vehicles.

## Checkpoints
The project is divided into several checkpoints, each focusing on specific skills and techniques. The checkpoints are as follows:

### Basics of Python
In this initial phase, we cover the fundamentals of Python programming, ensuring a strong foundation for further development.

### OpenCV and Image Processing
Here, we delve into the world of computer vision using the OpenCV library. We implement various image processing operations like resizing, rotation, grayscale conversion, blurring, and edge detection.

### Assignment 1
This checkpoint involves solving a specific assignment related to computer vision and image processing to test our understanding and skills acquired in the previous checkpoints.

### Basics of Machine Learning and Deep Learning
In this phase, we transition into machine learning and deep learning concepts essential for understanding object detection algorithms.

### Training YOLOv5 Model
The final and crucial checkpoint, where we train a YOLOv5 model using labeled datasets and fine-tune it for object detection tasks relevant to driverless vehicles.
